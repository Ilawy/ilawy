in <code>Psychopathology Of Everyday Life</code>, Freud discusses the phenomenon of forgetting, which he describes as a natural and common occurrence. He suggests that forgetting is not merely a failure of memory, but rather a complex psychological process that can reveal deeper insights into our mental state.

After reading this book, I started noticing the pattern of forgetting in my thought process, especially when I try to recall something important. It often feels like my mind is playing tricks on me, leading me to forget things that I thought I would never forget. This has made me more aware of the way I approach my thoughts and memories, making it a conscious effort to remember things that matter to me.
